Brainstorming for createCT.sh script
-because why rely on being able to consistently do it in 2 mins or less via GUI when I can FAIL TO AUTOMATE IT FOR 6 HOURS?!


Template to use: debian11
-need to find correct CLI tools to list local storage
	-if template not found; download template (need to know cli tool to accomplish this)

If we can successfully check for the template (and if missing, download it), then we need to CREATE the template with the following:

ID 300
Name sandbox-debian
RAM 1GB
ntwrk local (e.g. default vmbr0)
nesting and fuse options set to true/on
Can likely have ^^ be const variables
